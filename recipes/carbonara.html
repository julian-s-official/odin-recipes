    <h2>How to Make Carbonara</h2>
    <p>For this easy pasta sauce will cook in about the same time it
      takes to cook some dried pasta in boiling salted water – we’re 
      talking about quick and easy options here. These amounts serve 
      2 but are easy to scale up or down. Remember you want about 
      75g of dried pasta per person – use whatever shape you’ve got. 
      Or, check out my super-simple method for fresh pasta, using 
      just flour and water.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>150 g dried spaghetti </li>
      <li>2 rashers of higher-welfare smoked streaky bacon</li>
      <li>olive oil </li>
      <li>2 free-range eggs </li>
      <li>30 g Parmesan cheese , plus extra for grating</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Cook the pasta in a pan of boiling salted water according 
        to the packet instructions.</li>
      <li>Slice the bacon and place in a non-stick frying pan on a 
        medium heat with half a tablespoon of olive oil and a really 
        good pinch of black pepper. Leave it to get super-golden and 
        crispy, tossing occasionally, then turn off the heat.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, beat the eggs in a bowl, then finely grate in 
        the Parmesan and mix well.</li>
      <li>Use tongs to transfer your pasta straight into the pan 
        and toss with the bacon.</li>
      <li>Pour the Parmesan eggs into the pan, and keep everything 
        moving, loosening with splashes of the pasta cooking water 
        until you have a silky sauce. Make sure the pan isn’t too 
        hot otherwise the eggs will scramble. </li>
      <li>Plate up the pasta, and finish with an extra grating of Parmesan.</li>
    </ol>
