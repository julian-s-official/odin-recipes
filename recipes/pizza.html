    <h2>How to Make Pizza</h2>
    <p> What to do when your 8-year old nephew comes to visit? Make 
        pizza, of course!</p>
    <p>Well, not of course, actually. I didn't think of it until 
        we exhausted Sorry, Monopoly, and gin rummy. But it did turn 
        out to be a brilliant idea as my father had just received a 
        baking stone for Christmas, and my nephew loves pizza. </p>
    <p>I told him if he helped me make it I would talk about him 
        on my website and he would be famous. That seemed to get 
        his attention. He thought the dough was "slimy and gross" 
        but he loved picking his own toppings, and the finished 
        product was "awesome". </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 1/2 cups (355 ml) warm water (105°F-115°F) </li>
      <li>1 package (2 1/4 teaspoons) active dry yeast </li>
      <li>3 3/4 cups (490g) bread flour </li>
      <li>2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (omit if cooking 
        pizza in a wood-fired pizza oven) </li>
      <li>2 teaspoons kosher salt </li>
      <li>1 teaspoon sugar </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Proof the yeast</li>
      <li>Make and knead the pizza dough</li>
      <li>Let the dough rise</li>
      <li>Preheat the pizza stone (or pizza pan or baking sheet)</li>
      <li>Divide the dough into two balls</li>
      <li>Prep the toppings</li>
      <li>Flatten the dough ball, and stretch out into a round</li>
      <li>Brush the dough top with olive oil</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the pizza peel with corn meal, put flattened 
        dough on top</li>
      <li>Spread with tomato sauce and sprinkle with toppings</li>
      <li>Sprinkle the cornmeal on pizza stone, slide pizza onto pizza
        stone in oven</li>

    </ol>
